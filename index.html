                Welcome to the Roadster Recon. 
                This is a simple game where your goal is to retrieve the Roadster hidden in the completely dark 15x15 warehouse and escape. 
                The catch is Mr. Musk is sleeping somewhere in the facility. 
                If you wake him he will start chasing you and if he catches you, you will be sent into space with the roadster, becoming "StarMan".
                Their is also a Ford Pinto, and Honda Civic in the facility.
                If you get into one of these cars while Musk is awake, you will be caught!
                You may only move 1 square at a time (up, left, right, or down), and can "see" the squares in the 3x3 area with your position as the center.
                Good luck!
            </p>
